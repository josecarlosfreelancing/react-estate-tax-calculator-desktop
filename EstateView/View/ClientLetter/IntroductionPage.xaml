        <Bold>INTRODUCTION TO THE FEDERAL ESTATE TAX SYSTEM</Bold>
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        When a person dies, the federal estate and gift tax systems add up the value of the person’s
        assets, allowing deductions for assets that pass to charity, to a spouse, or to special
        trusts for charities and spouses.  The amount that can pass estate tax free is called
        the estate tax exemption.  Each person is entitled to his or her own estate tax exemption.
        If the value of an estate minus allowable deductions is less than the estate tax exemption, 
        no estate tax is due.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Underline>Marital Deduction</Underline>
        <LineBreak/>
        The law provides an unlimited marital deduction so that spouses can transfer assets to each
        other, either directly or under a Marital Deduction Trust, without incurring estate or gift
        tax.  Therefore, if the first spouse gives all of his or her assets to his surviving spouse
        or to a Marital Deduction Trust, his estate will not pay any estate or gift tax.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Underline>Federal Estate Tax Allowance</Underline>
        <LineBreak/>
        Another planning tool is to use the federal estate tax allowance that is increased
        annually in proportion to increases in the Consumer Price Index.  The present allowance
        is
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" /> ,
        and is allowed to be combined for a couple.  This allows the surviving spouse
        to use both their personal
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        (minus prior taxable gifting) allowance, plus CPI
        increases to such allowance, plus whatever remaining estate tax exemption that was not
        used on the first spouse's death.  Any unused allowance at the death of the first spouse
        will be available to the second spouse through something called the portability allowance.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        The portability allowance allows the surviving spouse to use any leftover portion of the
        deceased spouse’s estate tax allowance.  So if A only used $1,000,000 of the
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        allowed, B would be able to use the leftover
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmountMinusOneMillion, StringFormat=C0}" />
        which combined with B’s
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        allowance, would allow B to shelter
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmountDoubledMinusOneMillion, StringFormat=C0}" />
        on B’s death. The portability allowance does not increase with inflation, and is a lifetime amount.
        Therefore if an individual makes gifts over the annual amount allowed (presently
        <Run Text="{Binding AnnualGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        per beneficiary),
        those gifts would be subtracted from the lifetime
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        allowance.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        The portability allowance may be lost or reduced in the event of a second marriage,
        where the surviving spouse remarries to someone with a smaller or no estate tax
        exemption, and the new spouse is the first to die.

        <LineBreak/>
        <Underline>Annual Gifting</Underline>
        <LineBreak/>
        An individual is permitted to give another person an annual amount without incurring
        gift tax.  This amount changes with inflation, and is presently set at
        <Run Text="{Binding AnnualGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        for an individual (for
        <Run Text="{Binding CurrentYear}" />). 
        This amount can be combined with a spouse’s amount to allow a couple to give a gift
        in the amount of
        <Run Text="{Binding AnnualGiftExclusionAmountDoubled, StringFormat=C0}" /> .  
        The individual or couple are allowed to gift to as many people as they want within the
        year, but they can only gift the maximum amount to each individual once a year.  Also, gifts
        between spouses, no matter the amount, are always tax free.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        Annual gifting can combined with different estate planning techniques to maximize the amount
        of gifts to an individual, often to a child or grandchild.  Any gifts made under the annual
        gifting exclusion will not affect the estate annual allowance.  Any gifts over the annual 
        gifting amount will require the filing of a gift tax return, and will be subtracted from
        what is called the gift tax exemption amount.  This is set at
        <Run Text="{Binding LifetimeGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />.  
        Upon death, the balance of this amount becomes the individual’s federal estate tax allowance.
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        There are several ways to make use of the first dying spouse's (and growing) allowance to
        shield assets from federal estate tax on the surviving spouse's death.  The following
        illustrations will show how proper estate planning techniques work, and how they can
        work individually or together for your estate plan.
