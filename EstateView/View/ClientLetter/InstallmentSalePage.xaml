        <Bold>ILLUSTRATION 6 - YEAR 1 GIFT / INSTALLMENT SALE</Bold>
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        Here we show one of the most effective tools available to reduce Estate Tax exposure; the installment sale to an irrevocable trust.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        The "Irrevocable Sale Trust" now shown on the right hand side can be separate and apart from you for Federal Estate
        and Gift Tax purposes, but you will be able to pay the income tax attributable to assets held under the Trust for
        as long as you decide. Your payment of these taxes will not be considered to be a gift for Estate and Gift Tax purposes
        under the present law.
        <Run Text="{Binding TrustIncomeTaxPaymentText}" />.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        We are showing that you would make a
        <Run Text="{Binding SeedCapitalAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        seed capital gift to the trust, and shortly thereafter sell an ownership interest in an
        LLC or Family Limited Partnership in exchange for a Promissory Note.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        We show this as being a
        <Run Text="{Binding SaleValueAfterDiscount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        sale with reference to the amount of the sale, after taking into account a
        <Run Text="{Binding NoteDiscountRate, StringFormat=P2}" />
        valuation discount.
        In other words,
        <Run Text="{Binding SaleValueBeforeDiscount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        worth of assets are involved with the underlying LLC or Family Limited Partnership interest, but based upon a
        <Run Text="{Binding NoteDiscountRate, StringFormat=P2}" />
        discount, this is seen as a
        <Run Text="{Binding SaleValueAfterDiscount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        sale.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        <Run Text="{Binding NoteDetailsText}" />
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        As you can see, we show the sale occurring in
        <Run Text="{Binding CurrentYear}" />, and the final results of the sale on the 2nd death in
        <Run Text="{Binding YearOfSecondDeath}" />. 
        At that time, the Installment Sale Trust will have
        <Run Text="{Binding TrustValueOnSecondDeath, StringFormat=C0}" />.
        of assets that can pass estate tax free into
        trusts for your children or others that can benefit them during their lifetimes, but will never be subject to
        estate tax upon their eventual deaths.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        The total estate tax savings from this technique would be
        <Run Text="{Binding EstateTaxSavings, StringFormat=C0}" /> .
        based upon the assumptions set forth herein.
