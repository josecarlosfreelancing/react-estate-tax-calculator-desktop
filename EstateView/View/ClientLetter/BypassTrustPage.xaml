        <Bold>ILLUSTRATION 2 - BYPASS TRUST</Bold>

        <LineBreak />
        A Bypass Trust, also known as a "Family Trust" or "Credit Shelter Trust" is used to protect
        the assets of the first dying spouse from tax at the death of the surviving spouse, while
        still providing support for the surviving spouse.  At the first death, the property that
        would go to the surviving spouse is given up, or disclaimed, by the surviving spouse.  
        Then, estate planning mechanisms made in advance will move the property into a Bypass Trust.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        Once placed in the trust, the assets can be placed in a separate trust called a Generation
        Skipping Trust, to benefit descendants who are more than one generation level from the
        grantor (i.e. a grandchild).  An estate planning professional would be able to discuss further options.

        Here we show the funding of a Bypass Trust on the first death.  In this illustration, the deceased
        spouse's estate tax exclusion is used to the extent of
        <Run Text="{Binding InitialBypassTrustValue, StringFormat=C0}" />
        by the funding of the Bypass Trust shown in the second column, on
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />'s
        death in
        <Run Text="{Binding YearOfFirstSpousesDeath}" />.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        Under this scenario, the Bypass Trust grows to
        <Run Text="{Binding FinalBypassTrustValue, StringFormat=C0}" />,
        based upon the
        <Run Text="{Binding InvestmentsNetGrowthRate, StringFormat=\{0:0.00%\}}" />
        net rate of return assumption, and will not be subject to federal estate tax on the second death.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        This saves
        <Run Text="{Binding EstateTaxSavingsFromBypassTrust, StringFormat=C0}" />
        in federal estate tax.
