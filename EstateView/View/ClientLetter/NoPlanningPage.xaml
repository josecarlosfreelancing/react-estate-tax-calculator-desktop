        <Bold>ILLUSTRATION 1 - NO PLANNING</Bold>
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        This first illustration assumes no use of annual gifting, nor of life insurance trusts.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        The first row shows
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" /> and
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />’s assets in
        <Run Text="{Binding CurrentYear}" />.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        In the second row, we assume there has been a death of <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />.  The chart reflects the increases of the assets.  At <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />’s death, <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" /> received the life insurance.  This row shows all assets to the surviving spouse are thus subject to federal estate tax on the second death.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        Many couples will allow this to occur, and use an estate tax portability allowance.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        For purposes of this illustration, we are showing that the surviving spouse will therefore have a total exemption of
        <Run Text="{Binding TotalExclusionAvailable, StringFormat=C0}" />
        (<Run Text="{Binding DeceasedSpousesExclusionAvailable, StringFormat=C0}" />
        from <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />'s unused exemption +
        <Run Text="{Binding SurvivingSpousesExclusionAvailable, StringFormat=C0}" />
        from  <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />'s unused exemption).
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        The third row illustrates <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />’s estate at her death.
        We show her dying
        <Run Text="{Binding NumberOfYearsBetweenFirstAndSecondDeath}" /> years later
        (<Run Text="{Binding NumberOfYearsBetweenNowAndSecondDeath}" /> years from now),
        and having
        <Run Text="{Binding SurvivingSpousesGrossEstate, StringFormat=C0}" />
        worth of assets subject to federal estate tax.
        Life insurance is also subject to federal estate tax on the second death.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        The total estate taxable assets of <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />
        minus the allowance of <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" /> leaves
        <Run Text="{Binding TaxableValueOfEstate, StringFormat=C0}" />
        subject to federal estate tax. Assuming a
        <Run Text="{Binding EstateTaxRate, StringFormat=\{0:0%\}}" />
        estate tax rate, the estate tax would be
        <Run Text="{Binding EstateTaxDue, StringFormat=C0}" />,
        and is normally owed 9 months after the surviving spouse's date of death,
        although payment plans can currently be obtained for large closely held
        businesses or actively managed real estate situations.
