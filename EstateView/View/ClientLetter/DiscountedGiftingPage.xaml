        <Bold>ILLUSTRATION 4 - DISCOUNTED GIFTING</Bold>

        It is possible that valuation discounts can apply when certain ownership
        interests are transferred.  Oftentimes a family will have a limited partnership,
        a limited liability company with investments or a business held in it.  Part
        ownership in this entity can be gifted, instead of cash.  When portion of
        the business is gifted, it will receive a discount under the theory that a
        buyer would not want to purchase an entity at full price if they cannot have
        full ownership in it.  For example, a buyer would pay more per share for 75%
        ownership, which would equal a majority interest, and would pay less per share
        for 26% ownership, which is a minority interest.  The difference in value from
        the majority interest per share and minority interest per share would be the discount. 
        This amount is often speculated, but a 30% discount is regularly advised.

        Ten percent of a company or limited partnership holding $1,000,000 worth of assets
        may be worth significantly less than $100,000 when valuation discounts are taken into
        consideration.  This will give the percentage transferred a lower value for estate tax purposes.

        In this example, we are assuming that discounts of
        <Run Text="{Binding DiscountPercentageForGifting, StringFormat=\{0:0%\}}" />
        of value can apply. For example, if
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />
        and
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />
        were to place $1,000,000 worth of assets into a family limited liability company or
        limited partnership and gift a 10% interest, then this would nominally transfer
        $100,000 out of their estates but would only be valued at
        <Run Text="{Binding OneHundredThousandDiscounted, StringFormat=C0}" />
        for estate tax purposes.

        The estate tax savings from the discount feature, based upon
        <Run Text="{Binding TotalAnnualGiftsBeforeFirstDeath, StringFormat=C0}" />
        a year of gifting while
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />
        and
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />
        are both alive, and then
        <Run Text="{Binding TotalAnnualGiftsAfterFirstDeath, StringFormat=C0}" />
        per year of gifting during
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />'s
        remaining lifetime, is
        <Run Text="{Binding EstateTaxSavingsFromDiscountedGifting, StringFormat=C0}" />.
