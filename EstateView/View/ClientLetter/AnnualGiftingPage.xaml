        <Bold>ILLUSTRATION 3 - ANNUAL GIFTING</Bold>
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        In addition to the use of the Bypass Trust described above, we show the use of annual gifting.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        An individual can gift up to
        <Run Text="{Binding AnnualGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        a year, or
        <Run Text="{Binding AnnualGiftExclusionAmountDoubled, StringFormat=C0}" />
        per a married couple,
        to any individual without reporting a gift.  There is no limit on the number
        of people someone can gift to in a year.  There is only the limit of
        <Run Text="{Binding AnnualGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        per person.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        In this example, the gifting is based upon
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />
        and
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" /> transferring
        <Run Text="{Binding AnnualGiftExclusionAmount, StringFormat=C0}" />
        per child, or grandchild, per year.
        This amount includes our projections of the increases in annual gifting
        that will be in accordance with increases in the CPI.  Annual gifting is
        also evaluated on an annual basis, and increases are in increments of $1,000.
        <LineBreak />
        <LineBreak />
        The combined savings from the annual gifting for both
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse1FirstName}" />
        and
        <Run Text="{Binding Spouse2FirstName}" />
        is
        <Run Text="{Binding EstateTaxSavingsFromAnnualGifting, StringFormat=C0}" />.
